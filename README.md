# CSCI 711 Ray Tracer Code

## Instruction

I use OpenGL with GLSL. To compile and run, open Ray_Tracer.sln, and run the program in debug mode.



## Code specification

Submission includes checkpoint 1- 7 and advanced 4.

Checkpoint 1 - 6 are written in RayTracer.fs (fragment shader).

Checkpoint 7 is in main.cpp, starts from line 119.

Advanced 4 is in main.cpp, starts from line 183.



In my code, you can search for comments "checkpoint 1" to "checkpoint 7" to find codes for each assignment.

The tone reproduction (checkpoint 7 and advanced 4) is turned off, you can go to main.cpp, line 220 to turn on any model. All tone reproduction results are in "./tr_output" folder.
