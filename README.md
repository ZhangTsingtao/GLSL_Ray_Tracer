# CSCI 711 Ray Tracer Code

## Instruction

This is my individual project assignment. I recreated the Whitted-style ray tracing image using OpenGL and GLSL. By utilizing the power of modern GPU, I could generate the image in real time (Press W and S to find out). 

Compile and run from Ray_Tracer.sln.

## Structure Explanation

main.cpp serves as the framework to pull up a quad plane made up of two triangle, and the vertex and fragment shaders attached to the plane generate the actual image. I ran over all these "hassle" because I want to exploit the power of parallel computation, and I did.

The core ray tracing code lies on the fragment shader. I pass the pixel position from vertex shader to fragment shader, and define all objects (along with their texture, transmissive and reflective properties) in the fragment shader, and shoots ray from that pixel to the scene.

In addition, main.cpp also serves as the tone reproduction tool using CImg, which is like a post processing. Because in GLSL, I could only access the single pixel, which is impossible to do the tone reproduction like HDR. What I did is I took a screenshot of the current image generated by the shaders, and do the tone reproduction based on that screenshot.

## Code specification (for grading)

Submission includes checkpoint 1- 7 and advanced 4.

Checkpoint 1 - 6 are written in RayTracer.fs (fragment shader).

Checkpoint 7 is in main.cpp, starts from line 119.

Advanced 4 is in main.cpp, starts from line 183.



In my code, you can search for comments "checkpoint 1" to "checkpoint 7" to find codes for each assignment.

The tone reproduction (checkpoint 7 and advanced 4) is turned off, you can go to main.cpp, line 220 to turn on any model. All tone reproduction results are in "./tr_output" folder.
